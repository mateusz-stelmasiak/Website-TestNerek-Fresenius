# Website-TestNerek-Fresenius
An online kidney function evaluation quiz made in cooperation with Fresenius Nephrocare and PerpetuumMedia. Designed by a profesional, made almost pixel-perfect. 
Users are asked to complete a set of questions, then their kidney condition is evaluated. If the evaluation isn't perfect and they live in a appropriate zip-code the user are then given a code for a free kidney test. The code can then be emailed or sent by sms.
